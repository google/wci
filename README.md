# WCI - Conversion Import for Whatsapp

WCI is an open source solution that enables advertisers who offer a WhatsApp channel to measure, attribute, target and optimize their campaigns through signals received in-chat messages. The solution offers a way to integrate and track conversions that happen in business-account WhatsApp chats by linking clicked leads (click to chat) to final conversions (scheduled events, purchased through chat app, etc). As a result, WCI allows advertisers to  bring visibility to the WhatsApp journey; measure in-WhatsApp chat interactions; attribute in-WhatsApp chat conversions and target audience-lists with Customer Match.

## How does it work?
 - User clicks on the Contact via WhatsApp link
 - A cloud function collects an identifier such as gclid and generates a unique protocol
 - The user is redirected to the WhatsApp with a pre-typed message with the generated protocol
 - Once the user sends the message, a cloud function / webhook associated with the WhatsApp Business Account - checks for the protocol and relates it to the gclid and phone number that the message was sent from
